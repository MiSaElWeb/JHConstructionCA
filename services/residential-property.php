    <h2>Disaster Restoration Services &#8211; Residential Property</h2>
    <p>When home owners have an unexpected emergency due to water, fire, or wind damage they need a company that can respond to their needs immediately.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">With over 60 years of family-owned experience<br />
    your satisfaction is our number one priority.</span></em></span></p>
    <p>The <strong>disaster restoration</strong> process begins once an appointment has been set to meet the homeowner personally to assess the damage and prepare a free estimate. Work can begin immediately to mitigate the loss, stabilize the environment, and prevent further damage. Once the scope of services has been defined in detail the estimate will be provided to the homeowner, and generally forwarded to their insurance carrier for review and payment.</p>
    <p>Homeowners have the ultimate authority to hire any contractor they wish to perform <strong>disaster restoration services</strong>. A restoration service provider with the capabilities of JH Construction should have you back to pre-loss condition rapidly. Ask if your restoration contractor offers a full compliment of services such as boarding up and securing the property, emergency services, proper drying of the structure, content handling, to repair and reconstruction.</p>
    <p>There are scenarios that warrant packing and moving all of the contents out because the home is severally damaged. When a home requires extensive restoration and reconstruction it makes sense to hire a contractor that utilizes bar coding and scanning technology to create an accurate inventory. In addition, content items generally are photographed as well before they are transported to a safe and secure warehouse where they will be cleaned, processed, and stored until delivery back to your home.</p>
    <p>As part of our commitment to quality our employees are well trained and experienced, most with over 10 years in the industry. Customer satisfaction is the cornerstone of JH Construction philosophy.</p>
