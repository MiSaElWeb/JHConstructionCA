Fire Restoration Website

I'm Currently Working on a fire restoration website that a client asked for and i'm trying to do this on version control to see how well it plays out.


/**************************** February 10 ***********************/

I just started the second version of the website, the 1.0 they didn't like, they said it looked a lot like a competitors, but now i have made a simple 2 bar layout.
